# DL3035 - Avoid `zypper dist-upgrade`

## Description
`zypper dist-upgrade` (or `zypper dup`) can upgrade the base system beyond
expected versions and should not be used in Docker builds.

## Goals
- Preserve the stability of the chosen base image.
- Prevent unexpected package upgrades during the build process.

## Specification
1. Iterate over each `RUN` instruction and split it into shell command segments.
2. For every segment beginning with `zypper`, check whether the second token is
   `dist-upgrade` or `dup`.
3. If such a segment is found, emit `DL3035` at the line of the `RUN`
   instruction with the message `Do not use `zypper dist-upgrade`.`
