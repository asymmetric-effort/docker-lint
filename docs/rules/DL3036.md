# DL3036 - Clean zypper cache

## Description
`zypper` package cache should be cleared after installations to keep images
small and avoid stale metadata.

## Goals
- Reduce image size by removing cached data.
- Ensure cleanup occurs in the same layer as package installation.

## Specification
1. Iterate over each `RUN` instruction in the Dockerfile and split the
   instruction into shell command segments.
2. Determine if any segment executes `zypper install` or `zypper in`.
3. Within the same `RUN` instruction, check for a segment running `zypper clean`
   or `zypper cc`.
4. If a `zypper` install occurs without subsequent cleanup, emit `DL3036` at the
   `RUN` line with the message `` `zypper clean` missing after zypper use.``
