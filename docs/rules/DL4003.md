# DL4003 - Multiple CMD instructions

## Description
Multiple `CMD` instructions found. If you list more than one `CMD` then only the last `CMD` will take effect.

## Goals
- Prevent ignored `CMD` instructions.
- Encourage a single clear container command per stage.

## Specification
1. Track whether a `CMD` has been seen in the current stage.
2. Reset the tracker on each `FROM` instruction.
3. When encountering a `CMD`:
   - If one has already been seen, emit `DL4003` for that line.
   - Otherwise record that a `CMD` is present.
4. Use the message `Multiple CMD instructions found. If you list more than one CMD then only the last CMD will take effect`.
