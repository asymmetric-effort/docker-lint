# DL3004 : Do not use sudo

## Description
`sudo` in `RUN` instructions leads to unpredictable behavior; use tools like `gosu` instead.

## Goals
- Avoid permission issues caused by `sudo` inside containers.
- Promote clearer privilege management mechanisms.

## Specification
1. Inspect each `RUN` instruction.
2. Parse the executed commands.
3. If any command is `sudo`, emit `DL3004` at the instruction line.
