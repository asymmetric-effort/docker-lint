# DL3002 : Last USER should not be root

## Description
The final `USER` instruction in each stage should not specify a root user (`root` or `0`).

## Goals
- Encourage running containers as non-root to improve security.
- Prevent accidental privilege escalation in image builds.

## Specification
1. For each build stage, identify the last `USER` instruction before the next `FROM` or end of file.
2. If that instruction sets the user to `root`, `0`, or begins with `root:` or `0:`, emit `DL3002` for the line containing the instruction.
