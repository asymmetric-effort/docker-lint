# DL4001 - Either use Wget or Curl but not both

## Description
Avoid installing or invoking both `curl` and `wget` in the same stage. Choose a single tool to reduce image size and complexity.

## Goals
- Keep images minimal by selecting a single download utility.
- Avoid inconsistent behavior from mixing `curl` and `wget`.

## Specification
1. Iterate through Dockerfile instructions, resetting state on each `FROM`.
2. For each `RUN` instruction:
   - Extract individual shell commands.
   - Detect whether any command starts with `curl` or `wget`.
3. If a single `RUN` uses both tools or if one tool is used after the other has already appeared in the current stage, emit `DL4001`.
4. Report the line of the offending `RUN` with the message `Either use Wget or Curl but not both`.
