# DL3050 - Superfluous label(s) present

## Purpose
Ensure images only carry labels defined in the expected schema when strict validation is enabled.

## Scope
Evaluates every `LABEL` instruction when a label schema is configured and strict mode is active.

## Rule Statement (normative)
Emit **DL3050** when a `LABEL` instruction includes a key not present in the configured label schema while strict mode is enabled.

**Message:** `Superfluous label(s) present.`

## Rationale
Restricting labels to a known set prevents typos and unauthorized metadata from entering images.

## Configuration
Provide a label schema and enable strict validation. Without strict mode, this rule is silent.

## Detection Logic (high-level)
1. If strict mode is disabled, no findings are produced.
2. For each `LABEL` instruction, extract key/value pairs.
3. Report DL3050 if any key is absent from the schema (one finding per instruction).

## Severity
`info`

## Examples
### Non-compliant
Schema: `{ "org.opencontainers.image.source": string }`
```Dockerfile
LABEL org.opencontainers.image.revision="abcd1234"
```

### Compliant
```Dockerfile
LABEL org.opencontainers.image.source="https://github.com/acme/project"
```
