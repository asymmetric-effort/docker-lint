# DL3001 : Avoid irrelevant shell commands

## Description
Certain shell commands such as `ssh`, `vim`, `shutdown`, `service`, `ps`, `free`, `top`, `kill`, `mount`, and `ifconfig` typically serve no purpose inside containers.

## Goals
- Ensure Dockerfile `RUN` instructions contain meaningful commands.
- Reduce image complexity and potential misuse.

## Specification
1. Inspect each `RUN` instruction.
2. Split the shell invocation into individual commands.
3. If any command matches one of: `ssh`, `vim`, `shutdown`, `service`, `ps`, `free`, `top`, `kill`, `mount`, `ifconfig`, emit `DL3001` at the instruction line.
