# DL4004 - Multiple ENTRYPOINT instructions

## Description
Listing more than one `ENTRYPOINT` instruction in a single stage means only the last takes effect. Remove redundant `ENTRYPOINT` directives to avoid confusion.

## Goals
- Ensure each stage defines a single entrypoint.
- Avoid accidental overriding of earlier `ENTRYPOINT` instructions.

## Specification
1. Track whether an `ENTRYPOINT` has been seen in the current stage.
2. Reset the tracker whenever a `FROM` instruction appears.
3. On encountering an `ENTRYPOINT`:
   - If one has already been seen, emit `DL4004` for that line.
   - Otherwise record that an `ENTRYPOINT` exists.
4. Use the message `Multiple ENTRYPOINT instructions found. If you list more than one ENTRYPOINT then only the last ENTRYPOINT will take effect`.
