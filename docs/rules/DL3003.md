# DL3003 : Use WORKDIR instead of cd

## Description
Using `cd` in `RUN` instructions is error-prone; prefer the `WORKDIR` instruction to change directories.

## Goals
- Encourage explicit and reliable directory changes in Dockerfiles.
- Improve readability by using `WORKDIR` for path changes.

## Specification
1. Inspect each `RUN` instruction.
2. Parse the executed commands.
3. If any command is `cd`, emit `DL3003` at that line, recommending the use of `WORKDIR`.
