# DL3011 : Valid UNIX ports range from 0 to 65535

## Description
Ports exposed by `EXPOSE` must fall within the valid TCP/UDP range.

## Goals
- Prevent exposing invalid or out-of-range ports.
- Ensure compliance with standard port numbering.

## Specification
1. Inspect each `EXPOSE` instruction.
2. For each port token:
   - Remove any protocol suffix after `/`.
   - Split ranges on `-` and inspect each numeric part.
3. If a numeric conversion fails, treat the value as valid.
4. If any numeric part is less than 0 or greater than 65535, emit `DL3011` at the instruction line.
