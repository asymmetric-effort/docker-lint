# DL3051 - Label value is empty

Labels defined in the schema must have a non-empty value. Hadolint only
evaluates this rule when a label schema or `--require-label` is
provided. If a required key appears with an empty value (after trimming
whitespace), a finding is reported.

## Examples

```Dockerfile
FROM alpine:3.19
LABEL org.opencontainers.image.source=""
```

```Dockerfile
FROM alpine:3.19
LABEL org.opencontainers.image.source="https://example.org/repo"  # compliant
```

When the same label key is assigned multiple times, the last assignment
is used. Only the final value is checked.

```Dockerfile
FROM scratch
LABEL foo=""       # ignored
LABEL foo="bar"   # OK
```

Whitespace-only values are also considered empty:

```Dockerfile
FROM scratch
LABEL foo="   "
```
