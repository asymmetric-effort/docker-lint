# DL1001 : Avoid inline ignore pragmas

## Description
Inline `# hadolint ignore=DLxxxx` directives disable lint rules and should be avoided to ensure all checks run.

## Goals
- Prevent bypassing lint rules by embedding ignore pragmas.
- Ensure consistent policy enforcement in Dockerfiles.

## Specification
1. Parse the Dockerfile and iterate over each instruction and its preceding comments.
2. If any comment or instruction contains the case-insensitive substring `hadolint ignore=`, emit `DL1001`.
3. The finding points to the line where the pragma appears.
