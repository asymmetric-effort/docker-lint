# DL4005 - Use SHELL to change the default shell

## Description
Changing the default shell by linking to `/bin/sh` within a `RUN` instruction is discouraged. Use the `SHELL` directive to specify a different default shell for subsequent commands.

## Goals
- Encourage explicit shell changes using the `SHELL` instruction.
- Prevent fragile symlink modifications of `/bin/sh`.

## Specification
1. Examine every `RUN` instruction.
2. Tokenize the instruction and split it into individual commands.
3. If any command begins with `ln` and one of its arguments is `/bin/sh`, emit `DL4005`.
4. Report the line of the `RUN` instruction with the message `Use SHELL to change the default shell`.
