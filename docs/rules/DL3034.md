# DL3034 - Use non-interactive zypper

## Description
`zypper` commands should run non-interactively to avoid builds waiting for
confirmation.

## Goals
- Ensure package operations do not stall the build process.
- Promote fully automated Docker builds.

## Specification
1. Iterate over each `RUN` instruction in the Dockerfile and split it into shell
   command segments.
2. For every segment beginning with `zypper` followed by one of the actions
   `install`, `in`, `remove`, `rm`, `source-install`, `si`, or `patch`, check for
   a non-interactive flag.
3. Acceptable flags are `-y`, `-n`, `--non-interactive`, or `--no-confirm`.
4. If the required flag is missing, emit `DL3034` pointing to the `RUN`
   instruction with the message `Non-interactive switch missing from zypper command: zypper install -y`.
