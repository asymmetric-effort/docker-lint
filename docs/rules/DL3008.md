# DL3008 : Pin versions in apt-get install

## Description
Packages installed with `apt-get` or `apt` should be version pinned to ensure deterministic builds.

## Goals
- Encourage reproducible builds by fixing package versions.
- Prevent accidental upgrades during future rebuilds.

## Specification
1. Inspect each `RUN` instruction.
2. Replace line continuations with spaces and split the command on `&&`, `||`, and `;` separators.
3. Tokenize each segment into fields.
4. When a segment invokes `apt-get` or `apt` followed by `install`, examine subsequent package arguments.
5. If any package argument that doesn't start with `-` lacks an `=` with a non-empty version value, emit `DL3008` at the instruction line.
