# DL3000 : Use absolute WORKDIR

## Description
Ensure WORKDIR paths are absolute so subsequent commands run in a predictable directory.

## Goals
- Prevent commands from executing in unintended locations.
- Promote clarity about the build context's working directory.

## Specification
Inspect each `WORKDIR` instruction. After trimming quotes, if the path does not start with `/`, an environment variable (e.g., `$var`), or a Windows drive letter, emit `DL3000` with message `Use absolute WORKDIR`.
