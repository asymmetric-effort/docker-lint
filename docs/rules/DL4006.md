# DL4006 - Set the SHELL option -o pipefail before RUN with a pipe in it

Set the `SHELL` option `-o pipefail` before a `RUN` instruction containing a pipe. Without `pipefail`, errors in piped commands might be masked. If you are using `/bin/sh` in an alpine image or if your shell is symlinked to busybox then consider explicitly setting your `SHELL` to `/bin/ash`, or disable this check.
