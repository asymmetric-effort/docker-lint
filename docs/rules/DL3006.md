# DL3006 : Always tag the version of an image explicitly

## Description
Specify an explicit tag or digest for images in `FROM` instructions. Untagged images can lead to unpredictable builds.

## Goals
- Ensure deterministic builds by pinning base image versions.
- Avoid unintended image updates due to unpinned tags.

## Specification
1. For each build stage, examine the base image in its `FROM` instruction.
2. If the image is an alias to a previous stage, `scratch`, or starts with a variable (`$`), skip the check.
3. If the image contains a digest using `@`, the check passes.
4. Otherwise, split the image on `:`. If no tag is present, emit `DL3006` at the `FROM` line.
